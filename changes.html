<h3>v9.06 - integrated the following fixes:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Remove Helmet Animations should be writing two bytes, not four</li>
<li>Icon Improvements will now use the common_armor_list library to generate its patch list of armor</li>
<li>Change Avatar When Wearing Robes or Armor now uses more compact lists for copying</li>
<li>Force All Dialogue to Pause now uses the far-more-compact code from IWD Tweaks</li>
<li>Code cleanup for Reveal Wilderness Areas Before Chapter Six</li>
<li>Two-Handed Bastard Swords, Two-Handed Katanas were recoded to generate their patch list on the fly. </li>
<li>Allow Stealth and Thieving Abilities in Heavy Armor per <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> was recoded with lessons learned from IWD Tweaks; namely unarmored bonuses are now granted. Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor had to be adjusted as well.
  <ul>
    <li><em>To-do: The armor list needs to be re-generated. Release a tool for players to help gather information.</em></li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Wear Multiple Protection Items now generates its patch list on the fly</li>
<li>Higher <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym> on Level Up is a little more robust, a little more compact</li>
<li><acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>-Style <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> works great with arrays, when they're not set up in an incredibly stupid fashion</li>
<li>Added functions.tpa so I could be lazy</li>
<li>Add Save Penalties for Spells Cast by High-Level Casters (BETA) now uses the updated version from IWD Tweaks. No longer patches spells w/o saves. </li>
</ul>

<h3>v9.05 - integrated the following fixes:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rolled back 2da lookups for ToB-style NPCs for arrays instead. Kids, don't code when you're tired because you'll make poor decisions.</li>
<li>Also extended bard pickpocket table to 200/level 50 for armor/thieving, stuck in a library and re-used it for remove XP cap</li>
<li>Rechecked logic in happy patch not applying to BGEE, removed commented-out code</li>
<li>Rejuggled armor assignments in thieving/arcane armor tweaks so that I could have one library for both with no stray assignments in the tp2 itself</li>
<li>Updated header (webmaster@gibberlings3.net is now Kat's), removed cruft</li>
<li>Avatar morphing script was no longer AUTO_TRA'ing, so did it another way</li>
<li>BG1 walking speeds was missing Aerie since she starts as an ogre (this really should pick up polymorphs/avatar changes, but no one uses this component anyway)</li>
<li>Rolled back source change for xr2400/xr2600.are copies (changed to work in BGEE but chose an area file that doesn't exist in BG2)</li>
<li>Streamlined mod NPC script patching in Fate Spirit tweak</li>
<li>Tweaked setup.tra for bad line breaks in the DOS window</li>
</ul>
<h3>v9.04 - integrated the following fixes:</h3>

<ul>
<li>High level stuff to make the diffs go wild (don't even think of a merge this until I can play around  on BG2/Tutu installs)
  <ul>
    <li>BGEE compatibility, which mainly meant adding a lot of conditional  commands to account for lack of SoA items, string re-maps, and avoiding area regexps (don't know if it's WeiDU or a bad key reference)</li>
    <li>Since I was doing it already for BGEE compatibility, tried to make the ridiculous ALLOW_MISSING block redundant by throwing in even more conditional arguments</li>
    <li>Why did I think a Cam's House Rules GROUP was a good idea? </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Added 'Fix Boo's Squeak', something I've been meaning to do <em>forever</em></li>
<li>Avatar Morphing Script no longer leaves an unnecessary script in the override</li>
<li>Fixed pink highlight outline for elven chain in Icon Improvements. Also now distribute BG2 leather armor ground BAM since BGEE lacks it</li>
<li>Hakt and Maneira had ranged weapons equipped, so Exotic Items now swaps their melee weapon instead of making them dual-wielders</li>
<li>Allow Thief Skills and Stealth in Heavy Armor now adjusts the ranger stealth table to go up to 200, allowing very high level rangers to creep around in heavy armor</li>
<li>Added winter wolf pelts to Gem/Jewelry stacking</li>
<li>Added BG2FP copy of the Book of Infinite Spells to Sellable Items</li>
<li>Made some tentative readme changes</li>
</ul>
